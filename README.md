# CPSC357_DA_CLIMB

This is a program made by Nathaniel Cuadros, Alberto Ng, and Matthew Olvio

Its the final project for our IOS CPSC 357 class where we learned how to use Swift and Swift UI in XCode to create programs and applications.

We used code from the class aswell as things we created over the semester and coded for the final project. This includes structures and ideas from the inclass tutorials.

This application is geared towards introducing new Rock Climbers into the sport. It has descriptions of moves, hold and other climbing things aswell as a Map that has a few Rock clibming  locations in Orange County CA.

Thanks!!
