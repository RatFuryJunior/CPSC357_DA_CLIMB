# CPSC357_DA_CLIMB

This is a program made by Nathaniel Cuadros, Alberto Ng, and Matthew Olvio

Its the fiinal project for our IOS CPSC 357 class where we learned how to use Swift and Swift UI in XCode to create programs and applications.

This application is geared towards introducing new Rock Climbers into the sport. It has descriptions of moves, hold and other climbing things aswell as a Map that has a few Rock clibming  locations in Orange County CA.

Thanks!!
